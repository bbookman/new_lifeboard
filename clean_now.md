  - Massive monolithic structure
  - Poor separation of concerns
  - Process management, signal handling, frontend orchestration all mixed
  - Complex error handling scattered throughout
  - Hard to test individual components
- **Impact**: High maintenance burden, difficult to debug, prone to bugs

**Progress Checklist:**

- [x] Extract `ProcessManager` class to `core/process_manager.py` and cover with unit tests
- [x] Extract `SignalHandler` class to `core/signal_handler.py` and cover with unit tests
- [x] Extract `FrontendOrchestrator` class to `core/frontend_orchestrator.py` and cover with unit tests

## Conclusion

This comprehensive cleanup plan addresses the most critical technical debt in the Lifeboard codebase while maintaining system stability through rigorous TDD practices. The phased approach ensures minimal disruption to ongoing development while delivering significant improvements in maintainability, testability, and developer experience.

The investment of 3 weeks will pay dividends in reduced maintenance costs, faster feature development, and improved system reliability. The TDD approach ensures that all changes are safe, well-tested, and maintainable.

**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1, Day 1 - ProcessManager extraction with TDD approach.
