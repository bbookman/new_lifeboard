### Plan for Error Handling Standardization

This plan will address two key areas: replacing generic `except` clauses with specific ones and implementing a structured, consistent error response format for the API.

---

### **Phase 1: Foundation and Analysis**

*   **Step 1: Locate All Bare `except` Clauses**
    *   I will perform a comprehensive search across the entire codebase (in directories like `api/`, `services/`, `core/`, and `sources/`) to catalog every instance of a bare `except:` block. This will create a clear checklist of locations that require refactoring.

*   **Step 2: Define a Standardized API Error Schema**
    *   I will design a consistent JSON structure for all API error responses. This ensures that the frontend and other API clients can reliably handle errors. The proposed schema will include:
        *   `error_code`: A unique, machine-readable string (e.g., `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`).
        *   `message`: A clear, human-readable description of the error.
        *   `details`: An optional object for providing specific context, such as which field was invalid.

*   **Step 3: Create Custom Exception Classes**
    *   I will develop a set of custom exception classes that map directly to the new error schema. This will start with a base `APIException` class and include more specific subclasses like `NotFoundException`, `InvalidInputException`, and `ExternalServiceException`. Each class will contain the corresponding HTTP status code and error code.

### **Phase 2: Implementation and Refactoring**

*   **Step 4: Implement a Global API Exception Handler**
    *   Within the main FastAPI application (`api/server.py`), I will implement a single, global exception handler. This handler will catch any of the custom `APIException` types raised from anywhere in the application and automatically format them into the standardized JSON error response.

*   **Step 5: Systematically Replace Bare `except` Clauses**
    *   Working from the list generated in Step 1, I will address each bare `except` clause:
        1.  **Analyze Context:** I will examine the code inside the `try` block to identify the specific exceptions that are likely to occur (e.g., `KeyError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `httpx.RequestError`).
        2.  **Replace and Raise:** I will replace the generic `except:` with specific exception types. Within the new `except` block, I will `raise` the appropriate custom `APIException` created in Step 3. This will delegate error formatting to the global handler, cleaning up the local code.
        3.  **Log Specifics:** I will ensure that the specific exception details are logged before the custom API exception is raised, improving traceability for debugging.

*   **Step 6: Unify All API Error Handling**
    *   I will review all API routes and service-level functions to replace existing error handling mechanisms (like FastAPI's default `HTTPException`) with the new custom exception classes. This will ensure 100% of API errors are handled and formatted consistently.

### **Phase 3: Verification**

*   **Step 7: Test the Implementation**
    *   I will verify the new system by intentionally triggering various error conditions (e.g., requesting a non-existent item, sending invalid data). I will confirm that the API returns the correct HTTP status code and the properly structured JSON error body in all cases. I will also review and update the `pytest` suite to reflect these new, predictable error formats.
