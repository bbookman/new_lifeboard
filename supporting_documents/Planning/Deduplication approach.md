# Deduplication Strategies

This document provides an overview of various deduplication strategies, their descriptions, and impact analysis.

## 1. Content-Defined Chunking

**Description**:
This strategy breaks down text into chunks based on its content rather than a fixed size. It uses a rolling hash to identify chunk boundaries, which makes it robust to insertions and deletions.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: Reduces data volume by identifying and eliminating redundant data segments. This can significantly lower storage costs and improve processing efficiency in data pipelines. However, it can be computationally intensive, adding overhead to initial processing.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The primary tunable parameter is the `avg_chunk_size`. A smaller size will result in more, smaller chunks, potentially leading to better deduplication ratios but higher metadata overhead. A larger size is faster but may miss smaller duplicate segments.

## 2. Inline Deduplication

**Description**:
This is a simple strategy that removes duplicate lines within a text. It treats each line as a distinct unit and eliminates any repeated lines.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: Effective for structured or semi-structured text where entire lines are repeated, such as log files or CSVs. It has very low processing overhead but is ineffective for texts with minor variations in lines.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: There are no tunable parameters for this strategy.

## 3. Hash-Based Fingerprinting

**Description**:
This strategy uses MinHash to create a compact fingerprint of each document. These fingerprints are then used with Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to find similar documents.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: Excellent for finding near-duplicates in large datasets with high efficiency. It reduces the computational cost of pairwise comparisons. The accuracy depends on the number of hash functions and the LSH threshold.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The `threshold` parameter in LSH determines the similarity level for two documents to be considered duplicates. A higher threshold is stricter, while a lower threshold is more lenient. The number of hash functions in MinHash can also be adjusted to balance accuracy and performance.

## 4. Edit Distance (Levenshtein)

**Description**:
This strategy calculates the Levenshtein distance, which is the number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into another. It's used to find strings that are similar to each other.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: Useful for identifying typographical errors and minor variations in text. It can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets, as it requires pairwise comparisons.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The `threshold` parameter defines the maximum edit distance for two strings to be considered duplicates. A higher threshold will group more dissimilar strings together.

## 5. Jaccard Distance

**Description**:
This strategy measures the similarity between two sets by dividing the size of their intersection by the size of their union. For text, the sets are typically composed of words or n-grams.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: Effective at finding documents with similar content, regardless of word order. It is computationally less expensive than edit distance for long documents.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The `threshold` for Jaccard similarity determines how similar two documents must be to be considered duplicates. A higher threshold requires more content overlap.

## 6. Synonym & Hypernym Checks

**Description**:
This strategy identifies semantic similarity by considering synonyms (words with similar meanings) and hypernyms (words with broader meanings). It expands the text's vocabulary to find conceptual duplicates.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: Can identify duplicates that other methods would miss, by understanding the meaning of the text. This can be very powerful but is also complex and computationally intensive. The quality of the results depends heavily on the underlying lexical database (e.g., WordNet).
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The `threshold` can be adjusted to control how much synonym/hypernym overlap is required to classify texts as duplicates.

## 7. Stop-Word Removal

**Description**:
This is a preprocessing step that removes common words (e.g., "the", "a", "is") from the text. This helps to focus on the more meaningful words for deduplication.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: Reduces the size of the text and can improve the accuracy of other deduplication methods by removing noise. However, it can sometimes remove important context, especially in short texts.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The list of stop words can be customized to be domain-specific.

## 8. Lemmatization & POS Tagging

**Description**:
Lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form (lemma), while Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging identifies the grammatical role of each word. This helps to normalize the text for more accurate comparison.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: Improves the accuracy of similarity-based deduplication methods by treating different forms of the same word as equivalent (e.g., "run", "running", "ran"). It adds some processing overhead.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The lemmatization process itself doesn't have many parameters, but the choice of lemmatizer and POS tagger can impact the results.

## 9. TF-IDF Vectorization + Cosine Similarity

**Description**:
This strategy converts text into numerical vectors using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), which reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents. Cosine similarity is then used to measure the similarity between these vectors.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: A very effective method for finding topically similar documents. It is widely used and performs well. The size of the vocabulary can impact memory usage.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The `threshold` for cosine similarity determines the cutoff for considering documents as duplicates. The TF-IDF vectorizer has several parameters that can be tuned, such as `max_df`, `min_df`, and `ngram_range`.

## 10. Dimensionality Reduction

**Description**:
This strategy reduces the number of features in the TF-IDF matrix using techniques like Truncated SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). This can help to remove noise and focus on the most important latent topics.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: Can improve the performance and accuracy of similarity calculations by working in a lower-dimensional space. It can also help to uncover latent semantic relationships.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The number of components (`n_components`) to keep is the main parameter. A smaller number of components leads to a more compact representation but may lose some information. The similarity `threshold` is also tunable.

## 11. Word Moverâ€™s Distance

**Description**:
This strategy measures the "distance" between two documents as the minimum amount of "work" required to move the words from one document to another in a pre-trained word embedding space.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: A powerful semantic similarity measure that can capture nuances that other methods miss. It is computationally very expensive and requires a pre-trained word embedding model.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The `threshold` for the distance determines when two documents are considered duplicates. The choice of word embedding model is also a critical parameter.

---

## 12. Fuzzy String Matching

**Description**:
This is a general term for techniques that find strings that match a pattern approximately rather than exactly. Levenshtein distance is a common method used for this.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: Similar to edit distance, it is useful for handling typos and minor variations. The performance can be a concern for large datasets.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The `threshold` for the matching score is the main parameter.

## 13. Lowercasing

**Description**:
This is a simple preprocessing step that converts all characters in the text to lowercase.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: A fundamental step for most text processing tasks. It prevents the same word with different capitalization from being treated as different words.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: None.

---

## 14. Tokenization

**Description**:
This is the process of breaking down text into individual words or tokens.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: A necessary first step for many other deduplication strategies. The choice of tokenizer can affect the results.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The tokenization rules can be customized (e.g., how to handle punctuation, hyphens, etc.).

---

## 15. Punctuation Removal

**Description**:
This preprocessing step removes all punctuation marks from the text.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: Can simplify the text and improve the accuracy of some methods. However, it can also remove important information (e.g., in "U.S.A.").
*   **Tunable Parameters**: The set of punctuation to be removed can be customized.

## 16. Whitespace Normalization

**Description**:
This preprocessing step removes extra whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from the text, typically collapsing multiple whitespace characters into a single space.

**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Downstream Effects**: Ensures that variations in whitespace do not affect deduplication results. It is a simple but important normalization step.
*   **Tunable Parameters**: None.
