**Remaining Sources to Cover**:
1. âœ… **Limitless Source & Processor** - COMPLETE (API integration, conversation processing, deduplication)
2. **News Source** - Headline fetching, selection algorithm, deduplication strategy  
3. **Weather Source** - Forecast retrieval, data transformation, caching logic
4. **Twitter Source** - Archive processing, data extraction, format handling

## Critical Recommendations - STATUS UPDATES

### âœ… COMPLETED - Critical Items

*   **âœ… `services/ingestion.py`**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
    *   **Completed:** Created comprehensive `tests/test_ingestion_service.py` with 1,000+ lines

### Important

These recommendations address areas where improved testing would significantly enhance the project's reliability and maintainability.

*   **`api/routes/`**: The API routes have some integration tests, but the coverage is not comprehensive. Some routes, like `settings.py` and `system.py`, have no tests at all.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create dedicated test files for each route module (e.g., `tests/test_settings_api.py`, `tests/test_system_api.py`). These tests should cover all the endpoints in each route, including success cases, error cases, and edge cases.
*   **`services/weather_service.py`**: The `WeatherService` has some basic tests, but they are not comprehensive.
    *   **Recommendation:** Expand the tests in `tests/test_weather.py` to cover all the methods in the `WeatherService` class. This includes testing the data transformation logic, error handling, and the interaction with the database.
*   **`services/news_service.py`**: The `NewsService` has no dedicated tests.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create `tests/test_news_service.py` with unit tests for the `NewsService` class. These tests should mock the database and verify that the service correctly retrieves and processes news articles.

### Good to Have

These recommendations address areas where additional testing would be beneficial but are not as critical as the ones listed above.

*   **`core/retry_utils.py`**: The retry utilities are a core component of the application's resilience, but they are not directly tested.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create `tests/test_retry_utils.py` with unit tests for the retry decorators and context managers. These tests should verify that the retry logic works as expected, including the different backoff strategies and retry conditions.
*   **`core/http_client_mixin.py`**: The `HTTPClientMixin` is used by all the API sources, but it is not directly tested.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create `tests/test_http_client_mixin.py` with unit tests for the `HTTPClientMixin` class. These tests should verify that the mixin correctly creates and manages the HTTP client.
*   **`services/monitor.py`**: The `HealthMonitor` service is not tested.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create `tests/test_monitor.py` to test the `HealthMonitor` service.

### Low Priority

These recommendations address areas where testing is less critical but would still be valuable.

*   **`core/ids.py`**: The `NamespacedIDManager` is a simple utility, but it is used throughout the application.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create `tests/test_ids.py` with unit tests for the `NamespacedIDManager` class.
*   **`core/base_service.py`**: The `BaseService` class is a core component of the application's architecture, but it is not directly tested.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create `tests/test_base_service.py` with unit tests for the `BaseService` class.
